# The making of a thesis

This is the project that goes through my thesis repository, extracts some data
from the .tex files (word count, character count, number of sections, etc),
compiles the pdfs, converts each pdf page into an image, then combines
everything into a movie file.

Requirements:

* Xelatex
* Python (see requirements.txt)
* Latin Modern (Roman, Sans, Mono)
* pdftoppm
